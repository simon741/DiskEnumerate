# DiskEnumerate
This is small program, which I'm developing in school at C++ seminar. 
Seminar is conducted by employees of Eset.
They help me with issues, give me advice and do code review. I am very grateful to them.

#### The main functionality of program is simple:
- It browses in depth all directories in input path and It writes all full path names of files in these directories. 

#### Other functionality:
- It browses ADS (Alternative data streams) of files.
- It checks target path of reparse points to prevant getting into infinity loop and getting out of parent directory.

#### Next task:
- Implement own iterator.


*Note: I didn't use github versioning from the begging of project*
